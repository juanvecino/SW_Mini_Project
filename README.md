# WebChat

Firebase and Native-based web chat application that allows registered users to chat with each other in real time.
Project Partners: Bora Bulut and Juan Vecino
The work was split equally. Bora worked mostly on front-end, and Juan mostly worked on back-end.

### Login Page

The login page has a simple UI that greets the user with a welcome text at top center. Right below it, there is a Google authentication button that allows the user sign in with their Google account. This is the only sign in method.

### Main Chat Page

Once the user is logged in, they are taken to the main chat page where there is a search bar on the upper left hand side, which the user can use to search for other users by their name, last name, or email. The left column is dedicated to active chats. The user can conveniently pick from the list to chat with the person of interest.

### Chat Box

After the users pick the person they want to start conversation with, the chat section on the right side gets activated and shows the name of the person that's being chat with. When the user types their message and presses send, the text is displayed on the right with the name and last name of the sender, date, and time right above it. Received messages are shown in the same format but on the left side.
